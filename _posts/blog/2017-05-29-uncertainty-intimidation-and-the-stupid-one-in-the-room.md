It has been a week since I arrived at New York and I have also managed
to complete my first week of the Recurse Center. And the good news is
that I survived!

Leading up to the [first day at RC](/blog/day-0-at-recurse-center/) I
felt a bit nervous, mostly because of two reasons:

1. This is the first time I've stepped out of my country (India) and
   travelled so far out.
2. I quit my job to do this, I better make the most of this (hello,
   impostor syndrome).

Naturally the nervousness carried into my first day, but once I
started speaking to a few people, from my batch and the overlapping
one, things seemed to settle down a
bit. [Veit Heller](https://github.com/hellerve) explained my thoughts
on this in a nice
[blog post](http://blog.veitheller.de/Awkwardness.html) better than I
could have done myself. However, I was not prepared for another thing:
uncertainty.

Although the nerves calmed down a bit, but the uncertainty still
loomed large over my head. I knew which areas I wanted to focus on
during my time at RC, which was networking and systems programming,
the projects that I had in mind were outside my programming
capabilities. But that is the point of RC, to be able to push your
abilities each day.

By the end of the first day, I was doing something completely
unexpected. I spoke to [Hang Lu Su](https://github.com/homeowmorphism)
about my inhibitions with math, and she recommended a few resources
that explain math concepts in a much more intuitive way. And I found
myself reading up on calculus from
[here](https://betterexplained.com/guides/calculus/).

I wanted to write an HTTP load balancer and a distributed shell. So I
started researching about these on the second day. And yet more
unexepected things followed. I found myself digging through a [blog
post](https://jeremykun.com/2015/12/28/load-balancing-and-the-power-of-hashing/)
on hashing which included some serious math. I took the help of
[Katrina Evtimova](https://github.com/kevtimova) and she was very
patient with my stupid questions for most part of two days. I had
definitely not anticipated digging into deep math right at the
beginning. I enjoyed the blog post once I was able to understand the
math behind it.

I discussed about my project ideas with
[Saul Pwanson](https://github.com/saulpw/) and his suggestion was that
I start off with writing a basic shell first and build off from
there. I took that advice and made
[some progress](/blog/writing-a-unix-shell-part-1/) on that although,
not as much as I would have liked.

I also paired with [Jaseem Abid](https://github.com/jaseemabid) on
understanding LLVM code generated for a tiny script I wrote in
C. It was a very fun exercise, of which I would like to learn more
about.

I've lurked and participated on a number of conversations here and I
have been awestruck by the awesomeness of the people around me. I am
the stupid one in the room and I try my best to listen and grasp
all that I can. A few things do slip my attention but there's a lot
happening at RC all the time, and one can only keep up with so much
simultaneously. This gets a bit challenging, but I've started taking
extensive notes, which seem to be helping my cause.

I've also come up with a bunch of smaller project ideas along the way
that I might experiment with. I will write about them in more detail
later on if I end up exploring them.

## NYC

I have also had the chance of exploring the city, most of which has
been on foot. The city has amazing parks and you can sense a thriving
community when you visit one of them.

I spoke to [Nicole Orchard](https://github.com/norchard) and got some
good advice on buying and using a bike in New York and I was able to
get myself one, which I have started using for my commute. The ride is
about 8 miles, most of which is by the river Hudson.

The stay has been very enjoyable so far, and I look forward to another
great week at RC!

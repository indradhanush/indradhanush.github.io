Earlier this month on 11th November I participated in Django Girls,
Bangalore as a coach. [Django Girls](https://djangogirls.org/) is a
one day workshop aimed at encouraging more women to pick up
programming as a career option by spending the entire day going
through the basics of Python and Django and eventually building a
minimal web app for themselves. I was the coach in the 2015 edition as
well and had had an enjoyable experience. However, at the same time I
thought I could have done a better job of being a mentor. The few key
points that I had pledged to myself to improve upon next time were:

- I had showed up a little late at the event in 2015 and my team was
  already underway with another coach. I was introduced to my team
  when I arrived at the venue and we started with the workshop right
  away. This meant that I was unable to "break the ice" the way I
  prefer by telling my team that I was no different than them and I
  often got stuck with programming as well. As a result it is always
  okay to ask questions and as many times as it is necessary to
  understand a concept. Besides, if a participant is unable to grasp a
  concept after having explained it a few times then the problem
  surely lies in my teaching methods in not being able to use simple
  to understand instructions. And apart from that, one should always
  respect others time. I made ammends by ensuring that I showed up
  early at the event which not only meant that I was able to say hello
  to my team but also meet the other coaches. And we started right on
  time at 10 in the morning.
  
- I felt that I took longer than the other coaches to go through the
  Python basics at the workshop in 2015 and consequently felt a bit
  pressed for time towards the end of the workshop to cover all the
  concepts. I had also spent longer than what I intended on the CSS
  part of the workshop. This time knowing better, I informed my
  particpants that I would skip the CSS bits since I felt that the
  other core concepts about building a web app were more important and
  harder to pick up on their own. However I was unable to do much
  better than last time on the Python basics part of the workshop
  this time as well. But I've always felt that it is important to
  understand the basics of Python well before digging into Django. I
  had once tried teaching Python to someone while teaching Django at
  the same time and it did not go very well. While I do not have a
  better idea at the moment I am going think about this over time and
  try to come up with a better strategy.

Going through the basics of Python, understanding the concepts behind
how the web works followed by those that power a web app and all in a
single day is quite a tall order for anyone. I feel that (and I'm
probably not alone) it might serve it's purpose better if Django Girls
could be split across two days, one for Python and the other for
Django. But that also presents its own challenges like finding a venue
and coaches who can spare that amount of time at a stretch. I will not
go deeper into this as that is a topic for another blog post itself.

Another set of challenges that come with becoming an efficient coach
are that:

- One should always be very patient and open to answering as many
  questions as required. There's more on this in the
  [Coaching manual](http://coach.djangogirls.org/). While reading, I
  was pleasantly surprised to find the
  [social rules of the Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/manual#sub-sec-social-rules)
  adopted into it. I attended the Recurse Center earlier this year and
  it is by far my favourite programming community and the [best
  experience of my life](/tags/#recurse-center).

- Not all the participants are on the same level. Some might have more
  programming experience than others and some might be already
  familiar with a few concepts being taught in the workshop. As a
  result, being a coach it is important to ask everyone about their
  programming background instead of assuming that they must know a
  particular concept already. One strategy that works best is to
  describe all the concepts from a beginner's perspective. The ones
  who do not know about it get to learn, while it works as a refresher
  for the ones already familiar with it.

- A participant on my team showed up late on each of the 2015 and 2017
  events, which is probably my penance for showing up late myself at
  the 2015 event. It is always easier if everyone is on the same page
  but with a participant showing up late I felt like I was juggling
  tumblers while standing on a football and trying to balance a stool
  with one leg at the same time. It was surely stressful for me but I
  felt that it also hampered the other participants' progress who were
  already there on time. The strategy that I applied to manage this
  situation was to ask the person who showed up late to start reading
  a particular section from the
  [tutorial](http://tutorial.djangogirls.org/) with a very small and
  focussed topic. During the time that she was reading, I switched
  over to explaining other concepts to the remaining members of my
  team and once done asked them to work on a small and isolated task
  related to what I had just explained. I switched my attention back
  to the other participant who was already reading up on something
  else. My end goal was to get her upto speed with the others as soon
  as possible, which meant I had to ask her to skip a few parts in
  between. There were times when I found myself explaining critical
  concepts like what is an `HTTP` request and the difference between a
  `GET` request vs a `POST` request or how a database table maps over
  to a Django model. At such a juncture I would ask her to pause her
  work and listen along instead. I rinsed and I repeated.

At the end of the workshop I asked for the attention of all the
particpants and told them to form groups within themselves to stay
connected with each other. The reasoning being that it is easy to
slack off after the workshop and if one does not follow up and build
upon what they spent an entire day learning then the entire workshop is
rendered useless. I told them that it is easier to continue working on
this in a group rather than alone, since then they would be
accountable to each other. This thought did not occur to me during the
2015 event and I see it as a lost opportunity. Someone suggested to
create a facebook group and add them or create a mailing list. However
I insisted that they exchange contacts at the event itself because
tomorrow never comes and it's hard to regain the lost momentum later
on.

Finally after the long day, I had dinner with the rest of the coaches
and a few particpants. As a result of the workshop, I got to meet a
few people whom I only knew by twitter handles and IRC
nicknames. Organizing this event was no mean feat, and special thanks
to the organizers for selflessly putting in their time. It was great
to have been able to give back to the community and I look forward to
another one soon!

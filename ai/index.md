This is my tiny corner of the internet â€“ hand crafted by yours
truly. Did I build everything myself? No. I use Jekyll. I use the so-simple
theme. [I stand on the shoulder of giants](https://www.goodreads.com/quotes/10286-if-i-have-seen-further-it-is-by-standing-on).

But I do not use AI to generate content for this website.

I may write about AI. I may even use LLMs for research and experimentation, but
any content on this website will **always** be written by me. These are my
words.

I value your time. The time you could have spent doing anything else but instead
chose to spend here. Thank you for sharing your time with me.

Please check out the [AI manifesto](https://www.bydamo.la/p/ai-manifesto) to find out more on why I decided to make this
page. And if you do too, please consider listing it on this [public
database](https://slashai.page/new).

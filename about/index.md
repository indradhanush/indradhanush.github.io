I am a programmer who enjoys building infrastructure and developer tools. And I
love the command line. I have been programming for eleven years, six of them
professionally building distributed systems with distributed teams.

While I'm most comfortable with Python, Golang and Bash, choice of language or
tools has rarely been a hurdle for me while solving a problem. The best tool is
the one that does the job.

I am often available for consulting and if you would like to hire me, please
reach out to me via email: _indradhanush[dot]gupta[at]gmail.com_.

I attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in 2017, where I spent
twelve weeks to become a [better programmer](/tags/#recurse-center). This
remains one of the best experiences in life and RC is definitely the best
programming community that I have had a privilege of being a part of.

I write about programming and [human behaviour](/tags/#human-behaviour).

When not thinking about code, I play the drums and [paint](/paintings/).

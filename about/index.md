If you didn't get the reference to the bash command above already, I
am a command line nerd and I type at ~100wpm. I have been programming
for close to ten years, five of them professionally.

My expertise revolves around building systems from scratch and
deploying and managing them in cloud native infrastructures. While I am most
comfortable with Python and Golang, choice of programming language has
rarely been a hurdle for me while solving a problem.

I am often available
for consulting and if you would like to hire me, please reach out to
me via email: _indradhanush[dot]gupta[at]gmail.com_.

I'm currently having a lot of fun working remotely from India in the
containers and distributed systems space at
[Kinvolk](https://kinvolk.io). My work revolves around building
Kubernetes tooling for other systems that need to run inside a
Kubernetes cluster.

Prior to this I attended the [Recurse
Center](https://www.recurse.com/) in May 2017, where I spent twelve
weeks to become a [better programmer](/tags/#recurse-center). And
before that I was the fourth engineering hire at Instamojo, a payments
startup in India. At Instamojo I worked across the entire backend
codebase and also spent some time in the the Infrastructure team.

I write about programming and on [human
behaviour](/tags/#human-behaviour). Distributed sytems and network
programming pique my interest.

When not thinking about code, I play the drums or I
[paint](/paintings/).

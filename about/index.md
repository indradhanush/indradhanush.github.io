I am a programmer who specialises in building backend systems at scale and
anticipating failure modes before they can happen, identifying bottlenecks in
complex systems â€” both technical and non-technical and help ameliorate them.

While I'm most comfortable with `Go`, `Python` and `Bash`, choice of a specific
programming language or a tool has rarely been a hurdle for me while solving a
problem. The best tool is the one that does the job.

I have been programming for 13 years, 9 of them professionally building and
maintaining distributed systems with distributed teams. I am often available for
consulting and if you would like to hire me, please reach out to me via email:
[indradhanush dot gupta at gmail dot com](mailto:indradhanush.gupta@gmail.com).

In 2017, I attended the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com/) (RC) in New
York City, spending twelve weeks becoming a [better
programmer](/tags/#recurse-center) (and a better human as an unintended positive
side-effect). It remains one of the best experiences in my life and RC is
definitely the best programming community that I have had a privilege of being a
part of.

I write about software and [human behaviour](/tags/#human-behaviour) and when
not thinking about software, I play the
[drums](https://www.instagram.com/dhanush_on_drums/) and occasionally
[paint](/paintings/).
